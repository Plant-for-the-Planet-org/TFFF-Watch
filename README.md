# TFFF Watch

TFFF Watch â€” tracks proposed Tropical Forest Forever Facility payouts and visualises forest loss in eligible countries.

## Introduction

TFFF Watch is a web application that surfaces estimated payouts and forest-loss indicators to improve transparency and public oversight of tropical forest finance commitments.

## What is TFFF Watch?

A lightweight Next.js app that combines geospatial maps, summary tables and charts to show where payouts are proposed and how forest loss trends relate to those proposals. It helps stakeholders explore spatial and temporal patterns without requiring specialist tools.

## Features

- Interactive map visualising forest loss and project areas.
- Payout estimates and simple summaries for quick comparison.
- Filter and search by country, region and project attributes.
- Exportable tables and links to source datasets for verification.

## Data & Methodology

Data are combined from public datasets and project disclosures, processed into map tiles and aggregated summaries. Processing emphasises reproducibility and transparency: sources, transformation steps and assumptions are documented alongside derived results so users can review and validate findings.
