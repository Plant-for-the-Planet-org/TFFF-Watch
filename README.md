## What is TFFF Watch?

A lightweight app that combines geospatial maps, summary tables and charts to show where payouts are proposed and how forest loss trends relate to those proposals. It helps stakeholders explore spatial and temporal patterns without requiring specialist tools.

## Features

- Interactive map visualising forest loss and project areas.
- Payout estimates and simple summaries for quick comparison.

## Data & Methodology

Data are combined from public datasets and project disclosures, processed into map tiles and aggregated summaries. Processing emphasises reproducibility and transparency: sources, transformation steps and assumptions are documented alongside derived results so users can review and validate findings.
