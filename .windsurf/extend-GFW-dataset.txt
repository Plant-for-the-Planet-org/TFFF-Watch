I now want to replace the GFW Dataset with 2 New Dataset.
They will be replacement of the existing GFW Dataset.
New Datasets are "20% Canopy Cover Estimate (GFW)" & "30% Canopy Cover Estimate (GFW)" for short you can use "GFW_20P" & "GFW_30P" as Differentiating Keys.

There will be a 3 Tabs in DatasetTabs.
There will be 3 Separate Data Fetching.
  For Now I want to work on the Frontend & I do not have the API ready yet, so both of these dataset will be using existing GFW Dataset Query Params for Data-Fetching - but later they will be updated.
There will be 3 Different Query Params in the URL based on which Application should load right Dataset.
Both app/page.tsx & app/.../[country]/[year]/page.tsx will use this updated feature.

NO UI should be updated. Just Add the Functionality.
Correctly Implement the Feature with Mantaining Full TypeSafety. Fix all the Errors that might come in place.
